'After a day of traveling and meetings in NYC, finally settled down after dinner and started doing some thinking
over the code I've been rushing for the past few days. After giving a serious round of consideration, I've came to
conclusion that I need to refactor these code.'

'The following is my thought process:'


'Functions by users'

[game related functions]
-create a game        // to create a solo game, with the 'status' open
-get a game           // to get a current game, with the 'status' open
  --join a game       // to join a current game knowing the game_id
-match a game         // to get matched with someone who's currently in a game with the 'status' open
-get past games       // to get past games, with options to show opened games, in process games, and completed games

[summoner related functions]
-get summoner         // to get specific user data
-verify summoner      // to verify summoner runes page
  --create summoner   // register summoner on the server for MMR purpose
-get summoners        // to get all summoners, can be sorted by MMR, win rate and etc.


The actions map directly to several routes, which are described as follows:

[DONE!] POST /game/create        - create a new game
[DONE!] GET  /game/:game_id      - get one game using game id
[DONE!] POST /game/:game_id/join         - join one game given game id
POST /game/match                 - get matched with someone who's currently in a game with the 'status' open and no participant2
[DONE!] GET  /games              - return a list of games and associated meta data

[DONE!] GET  /summoner/:summoner_id     - return an individual summoner with associated comments
[DONE!] /summoner/create                - create new summoner
POST /summoners                         - return all summoners, can be filtered/sorted by MMR ranking, win rate and etc.

[DONE!]POST /public/summoner/data              - return an individual summoner with associated account & ranked status
[DONE!]POST /public/summoner/verify            - return a boolean value that verifies summoner if rune page has changed
